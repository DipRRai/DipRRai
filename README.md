### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤  The name's Dip, but you can call me Dip 
                                                    (apologies my name doesn't get any shorter than this ðŸ˜‚)

<p align='center'><img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=DipRRai"/></p>
I'm a student at The University of Melbourne currently studying Computer Science with a Major in Computation and Software Systems

ðŸ˜„ Check out my [portfolio](https://diprrai.github.io/onlinePortfolio/index.html) for some of my projects that you can interact with online!

ðŸ¤” My interests include:

  - Webdevelopment
  - Artificial intelligence, particularly LLM's and Reinforcement Models, Classification through Computer Vision etc.. but I'm also self-studying other models as required for my projects.
  - Robotics (I'm fairly new but I've had a go with some Arduino programming)

ðŸŒ± I'm familiar with Python, JavaScript, Java, C, C#, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, Express, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Tkinter, NumPy
   You name it and I've probably tinkered around with it. 
   
ðŸ”­ Always eager to learn new frameworks and develop my skills as a programmer.
